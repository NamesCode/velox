A minimal SSG CLI tool inspired by Svelte.

> [!WARNING]
> THIS IN ALPHA, DO NOT USE. NOTHING IS STABLE.

## Installation

A simple `cargo install` should suffice!


## Philosophy

Velox was designed with the Unix Philosophy in mind along with the idea that all data that can be known before build should be stored in a page.

## The name 

The name is the latin word for [quick](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/velox)!
It's also a nod towards S**vel**te.
